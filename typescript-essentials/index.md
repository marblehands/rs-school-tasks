## Reflections

### Get Started with TypeScript Module reflection

#### üìù Description

In this module I got a brief overview of TypeScript and its most basic key concepts. Personal reflections were written down based on the material covered.

#### üí° Key Insights

- TypeScript is a strict superset of ES6. That is why all JavaScript code is also TypeScript code, and a TypeScript program can seamlessly consume JavaScript.
- TypeScript was developed by MicroSoft, it is an open-source technology.
- Browsers do not understand TypeScript code. It is needed to be compiled and transformed into Javascript code by using the TypeScript compiler.
- The main feature of TypeScript are types, which can be defined explicitly by themselves or automatically according to the type of data assigned to variables, also there are many other features (interfaces, generics, abstract classes and much more).
- Modern web development is performed using TypeScript, so knowing and using this technology is a must.

#### üéì Key Learnings

- Learned TypeScript Basics: definition, key concepts, purpose, key features, pros and cons.
- Learned such concepts as \*type hits and type inference
- Learned how to set up a TypeScript project in VS Code
- Learned how to control TypeScript compilation through setting up `tsconfig.json` file with _compile options_

#### üë©‚Äçüíª Skills Gained

- Installation of TypeScript in a working project or globally in VS Code.
- Creating and editing a `tsconfig.json` file.
- Compiling a `.ts` file into a `.js` file in a given directory.

#### üõ† Practi—Åal Usage in Real-World Application

- Allows to detect errors before code is executed in the browser due to strict data typing.
- Provides convenient hints and highlights errors while coding in real-time mode.
- Simplifies code documentation.
- Simplifies collaboration in a large team.
- Eases development of complex applications with a large code base.
- Great for OOP style programming.
