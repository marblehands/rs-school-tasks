Hi, my name is Ania and I'm happy to introduce myself to you. I hope this video will help you to get to know me better professionally and personally.

So, I've been designing websites and web applications for the past several years. Working in that field gave me excellent understanding of high quality user experience and good looking user interfaces

In my profession I was very curious about how all that things on the web work, so I started digging deeper and finally I joined the Rolling Scopes School and its community of talented and smart people. I couldn't even imagine what a long and incredible journey would it be for me.

I’ve been learning Javascript, built two landings, learned how to make a slider on my own, learned how to work with audio in the browser, made a game using canvas, and much more. By the end of pre-school I decided for myself to take the main course and try myself as a junior frontend developer in future. Of course my code is not perfect and I still have a lot to learn, but I am a highly motivated and I believe that my efforts will eventually lead to good results.

As a team member, I am a hard-working and not afraid of a challenges. I am responsible and reliable person. Due to my current work, I am really great at meeting deadlines. Also I am a good communicator, that is why I got maximum scores in all crosschecks during both courses.

Last year I decided to pass a language exam to prove my acquisition of English language. I take an eight months preparation course, I studied hard, attended a lot of speaking clubs and finally passed it with great score.

Also I learned Polish and I liked it a lot. Living in Poland and talk with people using their own language is really enjoyable experience.

Now I live in Spain and think about starting to learn Spanish as well.

As a person, I like to travel and explore new places. Travelling and being in nature with my family gives me energy for work and study.

Well, that’s it! Thank you for watching! Hope you enjoyed the story. Have a nice day or evening! Buy buy!
